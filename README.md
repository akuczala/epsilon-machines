Given a deterministic or stochastic input sequence, this Mathematica notebook constructs a finite state automaton that captures the behavior of the sequence, according to the algorithm described in this [paper](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~theory/crutchfieldyoung.pdf).

The notebook also contains code for visualizing paths through the automaton.
